# Learning log

Read this first, at step 0 of every use. Append to it last, at step 9, in the
same branch as the work. Newest entry first.

Each entry answers five questions:

1. **League and scope**: what was asked, by whom, the date.
2. **Tried**: the grid rows worked and the methods run on each.
3. **New**: each new method, trap, price route or kill test, and the
   reference file it was written into.
4. **Corrected**: each claim in the skill that a measurement contradicted, as
   "was X, now Y, because Z (doc)". A method that failed on re-measure moves to
   failed in `methods.md`; a null is never deleted.
5. **The framework**: anything in `SKILL.md` that was wrong, missing or in the
   wrong order, and what changed.

"Nothing new" is a valid entry only with one sentence saying what was checked.

**Promotion.** When the same trap or failure appears in two entries, it stops
being a note and becomes a rule: one line in the `SKILL.md` step it belongs
to, pointing here. A method that has failed in three leagues gets a warning
at the top of its entry in `methods.md`. This is the same rule CLAUDE.md uses
for itself: a trap that has bitten twice is promoted.

**Review.** At the fifth entry after the last review, read the whole log for
patterns (a step that keeps being skipped, a trap that keeps recurring, a
method that only ever works in one sport shape) and change `SKILL.md`. Log the
review as its own entry.

## 2026-11-12 — Scouting outside the repo, and inventing before a null

1. **Scope.** mike: *"will it hunt for new appraches, data sources, sleuth
   online forums and repos anything it can find, OR invest new approaches if
   it cant find edge in a market?"*
2. **Tried.** It looked outside only from inside the stuck ladder, with no
   routes, no way to judge a lead and nothing written back. Probed the routes
   from mike's PC: web search, GitHub repository and code search, two betting
   forums, arXiv, Kaggle and Pinnacle's articles answered; Reddit refused a
   plain fetch (403 on reddit.com and old.reddit.com). One web search for
   women's college basketball totals models returned mostly picks sites.
3. **New.** `references/scouting.md` (when, where, the measured routes, search
   terms, the leads table, how to judge a lead, the rules for code, data,
   terms, sign-ups and paid sources, and the write-back). Step 2b in
   `SKILL.md`: a scout on every build. Rung 6 of the ladder points at it. An
   invention floor: three mechanisms of the session's own before any market is
   called null, the cheapest one run, the rest written into the frontier.
4. **Corrected.** Nothing measured was contradicted.
5. **The framework.** A scout now sits between the price inventory and the
   method search, and is repeated each season and when a live model decays.

## 2026-11-12 — How the skill learns, and what to do when stuck

1. **Scope.** mike: *"I want this skill to be self learning and self evolving
   and self correcting - is that the case? Will you look outside the box when
   stuck?"*
2. **Tried.** A review of the first version against that question. It was not
   self-learning: it had an instruction to write back and nothing that made it
   happen, no record of what each use taught it, no defined moment to call a
   search stuck, and nothing that noticed when a file or setting it cites had
   moved.
3. **New.** This log; the write-back gate and the line in the reply; the
   correction rule; the stuck signals and the ladder (all in `SKILL.md`). A
   test that fails when a cited file or setting no longer exists
   (`tests/test_league_models_skill.py`) is written on its own branch and
   merged separately, because any Python file redeploys the worker and the
   pollers, and in-play models were live when this merged.
4. **Corrected.** Nothing measured was contradicted.
5. **The framework.** Step 0 now starts with this log; step 9 is a gate, not
   a suggestion; a "when stuck" section sits between steps 5 and 6.
6. **Found while landing it.** The skill's own markdown-only merge (#1262,
   22:39:57 UTC) redeployed the in-play service (pollers BUILDING 22:40:00,
   DEPLOYING 22:44:05) with college basketball games live, because another
   session's code merge was still deploying there. The worker skipped it.
   Written into `shipping.md`, "After mike's merge", step 1.

## 2026-11-12 — The skill is written

1. **Scope.** mike: *"can we build a generalized skill for model building -
   all markets for a given league ... include approaches, the ultimate goals
   and leave open to explore and define and create and invent new
   frameworks."*
2. **Tried.** Every rule file, CLAUDE.md, the memory files, and every
   per-sport and market-search doc, read by four read-only agents. Every figure
   carried into the skill was checked by script against the docs.
3. **New.** All six files.
4. **Corrected.** The first frontmatter did not parse (an unquoted colon).
5. **Open, not resolved — re-check before relying on either:** whether
   `nfl_prop_tackles_assists` is live (`config.py` says it stays paused;
   `docs/nfl_prop_method_search.md` says it was unpaused 2026-09-09), and
   whether `ufc_total_rounds` is paused (`docs/sports/ufc.md` against
   `docs/paused_model_assessment.md`).
