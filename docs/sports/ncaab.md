# NCAAB — men's college basketball: data, odds capture, models

> **Started 2026-10-26 (mike: "built an ncaab model - season starts early
> nov"; the brief was rewritten into a build prompt and he answered "1) yes,
> 2) yes, 3 approved").** The 2026-27 season opens Sunday 2026-11-01 (Notre
> Dame vs Villanova, Rome, 9:30 a.m. ET); the full US slate starts Monday
> 2026-11-02 (182 games on ESPN). Season label: the ENDING year (2026-27 is
> 2027), as ESPN labels it, like the NBA and NHL.

## The models

None yet. A model goes live when it passes bars written down before its first
test (the build prompt's acceptance list: walk-forward by season with the
newest season held out; units, ROI with a confidence interval and closing-line
value against Pinnacle's vig-free close; its record against the opening and the
updated line on the Prediction Tracker's games; early season against late).
The research and its results will be recorded here once the first grid has
run.

## Identity: ESPN owns the games row

`data/ingestors/ncaab_teams.py` is the contract every other piece reads.

- **Team ids are ESPN team ids**, held in `ncaab_teams` with the school name
  (ESPN's `location`), a slug, mascot, display name and conference, for every
  Division I school AND every non-D1 opponent ESPN lists. `games.home_team` is
  the school name; the slug only appears in the game id.
- **Game ids** are `NCAAB_<ET date>_<away slug>_<home slug>` in ESPN's
  orientation, written only by the ESPN ingestor. `ncaab_events` maps ESPN's
  event id to that game id with both ESPN team ids, and a postponed game keeps
  its id.
- **The odds feed never mints an NCAAB game.** Its events resolve onto ESPN's
  games by the UNORDERED team pair within a day of the tip
  (`ncaab_teams.make_resolver`). When the feed calls ESPN's away team home (a
  neutral court: ESPN shows 30 of 69 games neutral on 2026-11-25), the names
  are swapped before the outcomes are parsed, so the stored spread is ESPN's
  home number. Names resolve through ESPN's display name, "school mascot",
  school, short name, alternate names, a school that starts the name followed
  by its mascot, and last the feed's shortened school names (Feed team names,
  below). A name none of them places is dropped, counted, and fixed by an
  entry in `config.NCAAB_ODDS_API_MAP` (name -> ESPN id).
- Three-letter ids were never an option: the old fallback turned "Kentucky
  Wildcats" and "Kansas State Wildcats" into the same team (measured
  2026-10-26: `NCAAB_2026-11-03_WIL_WIL`).

## Feed team names (2026-10-29)

The odds feed shortens school names that ESPN spells out: "Michigan St
Spartans", "CSU Fullerton Titans", "Loyola (Chi) Ramblers". On 2026-10-29 82
feed names placed no team, and the game-lines purchase kept 137,083 bought
event snapshots raw because of them (worker job 805227).

- **The rule** (`ncaab_teams._resolve_shortened_school`). It is tried only
  after every other step finds nothing, so a name that resolved before still
  resolves to the same team. The name is split into a school part and a
  mascot at every word. The school part's abbreviations are expanded (St, SE,
  Univ., CSU, Cal, Chi, Mt., BKN, Int'l; each one is there because a stored
  feed name needs it). The school part must then equal the school, short name
  or an alternate name of exactly one ESPN team, and the rest must be that
  team's mascot, or one of two aliases kept per team (Grand Canyon
  "Antelopes", Florida International "Golden Panthers"). When two teams share
  that school and that mascot, the name resolves to nothing.
- **The overrides.** 20 names no rule can place are in
  `config.NCAAB_ODDS_API_MAP`, each with the ESPN team and how many of the
  name's events ESPN's schedule plays as that team: schools or mascots ESPN
  names differently ("Dixie State", "Houston Baptist", "IUPUI", "UMKC",
  "George Washington Colonials", "Valparaiso Crusaders", "Long Beach St
  49ers") and names unlike ESPN's ("Albany", "Fort Wayne", "Tenn-Martin").
  "LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds" is ESPN 112358, Long Island University, not the
  non-Division I row 6446 called "LIU Brooklyn": ESPN's schedule has all 19
  of its events under 112358.
- **Measured 2026-10-29.** Over every feed name in `ncaab_odds_unmatched` and
  every name form in the ESPN registry (1,926 names), no name changed team.
  80 feed names now resolve, 60 by the rule and 20 by override, each to the
  team ESPN's schedule plays it as. Two stay unresolved on purpose: "Regent
  University Royals" and "Western State Colorado Mountaineers" each fit two
  ESPN rows.
- **The live capture uses the same resolver**, so these names now place from
  opening night too.

## Replaying the kept raw events

`python -m data.ingestors.ncaab_odds_history --replay-unmatched --seasons 2021 2026`
re-reads the events the purchase kept raw and stores the ones that resolve
now, exactly as the purchase would have stored them: ESPN's game, ESPN's home
number, the in-play label from ESPN's tip, and the same filter of what is
kept (the first quote, the evening-before and morning anchors, and the three
hours before the tip). It makes no paid call, never writes the pull ledger,
never deletes a raw row, and does not store a quote that is already stored, so
a second run stores nothing new.

- **A dry run unless `--apply`**, and the dry run's database connection is
  read only: every transaction opens READ ONLY.
- **The raw rows carry the feed's own time** (21:55:38Z for the 22Z
  snapshot). The replay maps each one back to the hour that was bought: the
  first pull-ledger hour at or after it, within an hour. A time with no such
  hour is counted and skipped. Stored rows carry each market's own last-update
  time as `snapshot_at` (the bought hour only when the feed sends none), as
  the purchase's rows do.
- **On the worker:** job `ncaab_odds_history` with `{"mode":
  "replay_unmatched"}` stores (every purchased season, 2020-21 to 2025-26);
  `{"mode": "replay_unmatched", "dry_run": true}` only prints what it would
  store. It takes no credit limit because it spends nothing.
- **What it should find** (Supabase connector, 2026-10-29, with the new name
  answers): 11,349 of the 11,857 kept events place on 11,300 ESPN games across
  the six seasons; 2025-26 alone is 1,958 events, 24,705 event snapshots and
  1,956 games. Fewer rows are stored than snapshots, because of the keep
  filter above.

## What runs, and where it lands

| Piece | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| ESPN schedule + results | Teams, venues, every game (neutral flag, conference game), finals for settlement; the daily pipeline refreshes 14 days ahead, every refresh pass fills finals for started games | `data/ingestors/ncaab_espn_ingestor.py`, steps `ncaab-schedule` / `ncaab-results` |
| Live odds | Full-game moneyline, spread and total from the ten line-shop books on every refresh pass; NCAAB is exempt from the DraftKings-must-list gate so every book's first post is kept | `data/ingestors/odds_ingestor.py` |
| Opener capture | Every 5 minutes, change-only (a row is written only when a book's price or line moved), so the time each book first posts is known | `scripts/ncaab_odds_capture.py`, job `ncaab_odds_capture` |
| Price-path retention | NCAAB keeps every book's whole price path (the clean-up job only removes unchanged middles), and the close it keeps for any sport is the last price before the start | `data/prune_odds.py` (`PATH_KEPT_SPORTS`) |
| Paid history | Game lines 2020-21 → 2025-26 (bulk snapshots: the evening before, mid-morning, and the hour before every tip); first-half and team-total lines 2023-24 → 2025-26, opener and close. Unmatched events are kept raw in `ncaab_odds_unmatched`, never dropped | `data/ingestors/ncaab_odds_history.py`, job `ncaab_odds_history` |
| Free history | Prediction Tracker lines and systems 2004-26, SBRO lines 2007-21 (matched onto ESPN games by date and final score), NCAA possession box scores and season player minutes 2010-26 | `data/ingestors/ncaab_archive_import.py`, `ncaab_sdv_import.py` |
| Feed probe | Which NCAAB events the odds feed lists and which names fail to resolve; which markets each book prices; whether the football data key opens College Basketball Data | `scripts/ncaab_feed_probe.py`, job `ncaab_feed_probe` |
| Replay of kept raw events | Re-reads the events the purchase kept raw and stores the ones that resolve now, as the purchase would have; no paid call; a read-only dry run unless --apply; a second run stores nothing new | `data/ingestors/ncaab_odds_history.py --replay-unmatched`, job `ncaab_odds_history` mode `replay_unmatched` |

## Data accounts and sources (measured 2026-10-28)

- **cbbdata (Torvik's API).** Account created 2026-10-28 (mike: "articulate the
  cbbdata sign-up with your email") and re-registered 2026-10-29 under the
  dedicated sign-up mailbox (mike: "change email for signups"): username
  `signalbaseskinny`, no confirmation e-mail required; the first account
  (`malkatrazz`, personal Gmail) is superseded and its values are kept as
  `CBBDATA_OLD_*`. The password and API key are in the local `.env` as
  `CBBDATA_USER`, `CBBDATA_EMAIL`, `CBBDATA_PASSWORD`, `CBBDATA_API_KEY`; they
  are NOT on the worker yet (Railway variable, mike's or an OAuth grant). Calls are
  `https://www.cbbdata.com/api/<endpoint>?key=<key>&year=2025&team=Duke` and
  return Parquet. Measured: `torvik/ratings/archive` holds daily T-Rank
  ratings for 364 teams per date for the seasons 2014-15 → 2024-25 (2024-25:
  232 dates, 2024-11-02 → 2025-06-30, 84,383 rows; columns rank, team, conf,
  record, barthag, adj_o, adj_d, adj_tempo, wab, proj_record, date, year);
  `torvik/ratings` holds season-end ratings 2008 → 2025; `torvik/game/stats`,
  `torvik/game/factors` and `torvik/player/game` answer for 2024-25;
  `torvik/team/schedule` is 404 and `torvik/game/prediction` 500. **The
  2025-26 season (`year` 2026) returned zero rows everywhere** — the API has
  no current-season Torvik data as of 2026-10-28, the package's issue tracker
  has had "No Bart Torvik Data for 2025-26 Season" open since 2025-11-11 with
  no maintainer reply, and two independent projects report the API stopped
  updating after June 2025, so nothing says it will return. The archive serves
  backtests; current-season ratings come from Torvik's own season file
  (`https://barttorvik.com/2027_team_results.csv`, HTTP 200 on 2026-10-28),
  which his robots.txt lets general agents fetch (Load-bearing facts below).
  Terms of use: none exist in writing for cbbdata or for Torvik's data; mike,
  2026-10-29: no permission requests to any data source.
- **KenPom.** The API subscription is $145.00 for 12 months with web access;
  web-only is $24.95 and has no data feed (live pages read 2026-10-28 23:34Z;
  the API page read $95.00 in June 2026). mike buys it in his own browser
  under the sign-up mailbox; the key then goes into the local `.env` and the
  worker as `KENPOM_API_KEY`, and the checks in the hand-off doc run. Eleven
  endpoints, the daily archive and preseason ratings included; no player
  availability. No permission request (mike, 2026-10-29).
- **College Basketball Data (api.collegebasketballdata.com).** Matt's
  question, answered by the feed probe on the worker (`ncaab-feed-probe-2026-10-26`,
  2026-10-28 23:25Z): **the football data key opens it.** `/teams` season
  2027 → 365 records; `/games` 2026 Duke → 38; `/lines` 2026 Duke → 38 with
  providers ESPN BET, Bovada, DraftKings, consensus, teamrankings,
  numberfire; `X-CallLimit-Remaining` 121,421. Lines coverage by season,
  plays, lineups and substitutions are unmeasured — the next probe.
- **The odds feed, first look (same probe).** 7 NCAAB events listed for
  2026-11-01 → 11-03; every one of 7 books prices h2h, spreads and totals;
  FanDuel also listed first-half, second-half, team-total, alternate and
  player-points markets on one game; BetRivers and Hard Rock alternate lines
  and odd/even; William Hill first basket. 14 of 14 feed names were
  unresolved only because the ESPN registry was still empty (the schedule
  job runs after the probe).
- **First night, measured 2026-10-28 23:36Z.** 747 ESPN teams and 3,491 games were stored within six minutes of the schedule job starting; the 5-minute capture resolved all 7 listed feed events onto ESPN rows (one of them flipped: the feed's "High Point @ Liberty" is ESPN's `NCAAB_2026-11-01_liberty_high-point`) and `latest_odds` held 143 prices from 7 books.
- **The purchase floor is 300,000 credits** (lowered from 500,000 on
  2026-10-28, mike: "dont stop the spend"): 3.5 of October's worst organic
  days (84,534 on 2026-10-04, `odds_api_quota`). The refill lands between
  the last day's 23:50Z reading and roughly 01:00Z on the 1st (Sept and Oct
  both show a full day's burn by the 1st's 23:40Z reading), so the resumes
  fire at 06:00Z–06:20Z on 2026-11-01 with 2026-11-02 copies as backstops.

## Load-bearing facts

- **Sign conventions.** `scored_line` / `spread_home` is the HOME number
  (CLAUDE.md §4). The Prediction Tracker's sign is the reverse (+3 means home
  favoured); the importer stores `-line`.
- **SBRO's second-half score is regulation only.** Grading a second-half total
  on it shows a phantom under edge (46.25% overs, against 50.04% with overtime,
  SBRO 2015-19).
- **Overtime** happens in about 6% of games: in full-game and second-half
  markets, never in first-half ones.
- **Player availability** has no free structured feed. Official reports exist
  for Big 12, ACC and SEC conference games (and the NCAA tournament pilot).
- **Torvik's robots.txt** (read 2026-10-29) bars six named crawlers, ClaudeBot
  and anthropic-ai among them, from the whole site, and every agent from the
  time-machine pages, `db.php`, `box.php`, `results.php`, `playerstat.php`
  and `.json` files; general agents may fetch the season CSVs with a
  10-second crawl delay. cbbdata holds nothing after 2024-25. The headline
  projection in his schedule files is rewritten after games (61.8% against
  the line in 2025-26) and must never be used.
- **College player props** are barred in 13 states (Unabated, 2026-07-29).
